# <span style="color:red">Challenges: </span>
We have faced few challenges while working on project we dealt with them , sometime it take lots of time but on the other hand we got some learning from that. some of the challenges are-<br>
As we are working on a team, we have to compile all the componets into the parent component sometime it messed if not appropriate tested earlier.<br>
Functionality of each and every thing should be more accurate. We have done this in precise manner. so that every thing will set up in a certain direction.<br>
Integrating third party payment gateyway was some issue earlier i figureout with concise practice. <br>
Integration backend to frontend as we were using react, strugled little bit during initial stage.<br> 
Getting  realtime data from the backend and working on it <br>
Deployment of full stack project with backed, frontend along with payment gateway was some trouble at initial stage takes some days to figure out, taken help from the google deployed successfully. 


# <span style="color:red">Conclusion: </span>
